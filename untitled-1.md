> **1 Corinthians 15:1-19 English Standard Version \(ESV\)**
>
> 15 Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, 2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.
>
> 3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. 8 Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. 9 For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. 11 Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
>
> 12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. 15 We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. 16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. 17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. 18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 19 If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.

What is the meaning of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and why is it so important?

The resurrection is the event where God the Father raises Jesus the Son back to life. Since the word “resurrection” means to raise back to life from death. The Resurrection is a bodily resurrection.

## Why Is It Significant?

Paul teaches that the Christian faith rests on the fact of the resurrection. Without Jesus being raised from the dead, the Christian faith is worse that empty. It is a lie.

## What is Death

To better understand the resurrection, we need to understand the meaning of death in the Scripture.

In the Scripture, death refers to different events. There is physical death, spiritual death and the Second Death. Despite having different manifestations, the meaning of death in all its variations includes the concept of separation.

### Physical Death

Physical death is the collective understanding of death, and what most people mean when they talk about death. Physical death is essentially when the human body stops functioning and the body has no pulse, no brain activity and no beating heart. This “physical death” exclusively relates to the body.

The human body is the house for our human spirit. By “human spirit”, I am referring to the spirit and the soul collectively \(although they spirit and soul are distinct\). Your spirit and soul comprise the essence of the real you. Your spirit is the part of you that interfaces with God. It is the part of you that got born again. Your soul represents your intellect, your will, your emotions and your memories. Your soul is the part of you that engages with this world. Your soul didn’t get born again, but it did get sanctified in the new birth. Christians are required to “save their souls” or renew their minds with the Word of God.

Once created, the human spirit \(that is the human spirit and the human soul\) is never destroyed. The real you and I live out our lives on earth in a human earth suit which we call our body. Let’s bear this out with the word:

> **John 2:19-21 English Standard Version \(ESV\)**
>
> 19 Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” 20 The Jews then said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?” 21 But he was speaking about the temple of his body.

2 Corinthians 5:1-3 English Standard Version \(ESV\)

> 5 For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 2 For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, 3 if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked.

James 2:26 English Standard Version \(ESV\)

> 26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.

We see from these verses that Jesus, John, James and Paul all agree that the spirit of a man is different from the body of a man. When the physical body is destroyed, the spirit is not destroyed, and the physical body cannot live without a human spirit inhabiting it.

Physical death is when the body ceases to function. James teaches that physical death also involves _separation_. During physical death, the human spirit is separated from the human body.

Physical death also involves complete decomposition. Given time and circumstance, the human body is obliterated.

Illustration

> When the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the summer of 1945, the poor souls that were directly in the path of the bomb blast were completely vaporized. Their bodies were disassembled at the atomic level in an instant. As an eerie aside, the thermal radiation that vaporized these victims left permanent shadows of them on the buildings and streets. In Japan, there are shadow images of children playing and people walking, but their bodies are no more.

### Spiritual Death

Spiritual death is a different manifestation of death. The human spirit cannot be obliterated in the same way as the human body. Spiritual death is not the spirit or soul ceasing to exist, but rather it is when the human spirit is severed from God.

> **Genesis 2:15-17 English Standard Version \(ESV\)**
>
> 15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it. 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”

Genesis 3:1-7 English Standard Version \(ESV\)

> 3 Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made.
>
> He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” 2 And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, 3 but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’” 4 But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. 5 For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” 6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. 7 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.

Notice that when Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden fruit they didn’t drop dead. They didn’t even die that day—physically. In fact, Adam and Eve would continue to live in their fallen state for many more centuries.

_But they did die spiritually. This means that their transgression separated them from God._ Adam and Eve would eventually die physically, but only because spiritual death lead to the decay and withering of their physical body.

Romans 5:12 New Living Translation \(NLT\)

> 12 When Adam sinned, sin entered the world. Adam’s sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned.

_Notice that spiritual death caused physical death._ God created man to live forever. But sin changed that. Sin killed man spiritually, and man’s spiritual death eventually leads to physical death.

_The main point is that spiritual death, like physical death, also describes separation._ Whereas physical death is the separation of the spirit from the body, spiritual death is the separation of the human spirit from God the Creator due to sin. Sin separates us from God, and sin leads to our physical death.

### The Second Death

The final kind of death presented in Scripture is the second death. The second death is unique from the other types of death because it is irrevocable. What is the second death? It is the permanent separation of the human spirit from the mercy of God.

But bluntly, the second death is when the human spirit is cast into the lake of fire and spends eternity in torment. Not a very happy thought, but true nonetheless.

> **Revelation 20:11-15 English Standard Version \(ESV\)**
>
> 11 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. 12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. 13 And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. 14 Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. 15 And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.

Once you are doomed to the second death, that’s it. You cannot reverse your fate. You cast in the lake and never come out.

### Death Summarized

From a biblical perspective, all manifestation of death mean separation:

* Physical death is the separation of the human spirit from the body due to the destruction of the human body. Physical death originated out of spiritual death.
* Spiritual death is the separation of the human spirit from God the Creator.
* The Second Death is the eternal, permanent separation of the human spirit from the mercy of God.

## The Nature of Jesus’ Death

Having looked at the meaning of death in its biblical context, we see just how remarkable Jesus was. In John 10:30, Jesus said, “The Father and I are one.” In this same passage, Jesus’ adversaries sought to stone him because in saying that he was one with the Father, Jesus was declaring himself to be God. The Scripture says:

“Then they were trying again to seize Him, yet He eluded their grasp.” \(John 10:39\).

Jesus of Nazareth was pure life. In this world, no manner of death could attach itself to him, because he was sinless and divine. He was God in the flesh.

Illustration

> Have you ever played with magnets? Do you remember how if you take two magnets and turn them just so, that instead of being attracted to each other, they repeal each other? As you bring the like poles of two magnets near each other, you can feel the force of repulsion.
>
> That repulsive force illustrates Jesus’ relationship with death. When his enemies tried to get near him to kill him, they couldn’t do it. When sickness came within the proximity of Jesus, it fled. When demons came near the Christ, they were expelled.

Since it was impossible for death to fasten itself to Jesus, the only way for Jesus to die was if he willingly laid down his life:

> **John 10:17-18 English Standard Version \(ESV\)**
>
> 17 For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. 18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.”

Jesus laid down his life at Calvary. To what end? What was the significance of his death?

### Jesus Died Physically

Certainly, Jesus died physically on the cross. Jesus was whipped and beaten beyond recognition before the Romans nailed him to the cross. After hanging on the cross for several hours, Jesus gave up the ghost; that is, his spirit left his body and he died. Jesus was also buried.

### The Significance of Burial

We bury a person only after they have been declared dead. We read accounts all the time of people whom doctors thought had died on the operating table, yet unexpectedly come back to life.

Most of the time, societies do not bury people immediately. Before a person is buried, someone pronounces that person dead, and then perhaps there is an autopsy. Often a caretaker prepares the body for burial. There is a funeral service that includes a viewing. Time passing, and the corpse has every chance to show signs of life before going into the ground.

After dying on the cross, Jesus’ body was stone cold dead. Joseph of Armathaea and Nicodemus took the body of Jesus, prepared his body for burial and placed it in a tomb, covered by a massive rock. The burial of Jesus, then, signifies the absolute finality of Jesus’ physical death.

### Jesus Tasted Spiritual Death

_Jesus also tasted death spiritually._ The Bible says that:

1 Peter 2:24 English Standard Version \(ESV\)

> 24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.

2 Corinthians 5:21 English Standard Version \(ESV\)

> 21 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

This is the mystery of the cross: _as Jesus hung on the cross, he bore in his physical body our sins that God the Father had laid on him._ The punishment for sin is death \(_the soul that sinneth shall die_\), and so Jesus was paying the price for our sins, so we would not have to pay that price.

Additionally, by becoming sin for us, Jesus _tasted_ spiritual separation from His Father.

It can be misleading to say Jesus died spiritually. I resist the temptation to force fit Jesus’ sacrifice so that my sermon flows well. It is not correct to say that Jesus died spiritually in the same way that Adam died spiritually when Adam sinned. Perhaps this statement better grasps at the mystery of the cross: _on the cross,_ _Jesus tasted spiritual separation from His Father—and became spiritually cursed for our sake—sufficient to accomplish our redemption, and to make us righteous before God._

Given this careful explanation, we say that Jesus tasted death spiritually and physically, on our behalf.

## The Glory of the Resurrection

If death is separation, then resurrection is reunion. If separation is to be rejected by a holy God because of sin, resurrection is the be accepted by a holy God because of righteousness.

_The Resurrection is anti-death._ It is a return to life, a return to fellowship with God that God intended for man.

Christ won the victory over sin on the cross. Father God raising Jesus from the dead is proof of the victory.

Illustration

> Have you ever seen an ultimate fighting match? This is a competition where two extraordinary athletes face off in an enclosed arena and try to knock each other senseless. I have seen matches where one opponent, with a single blow, knocks his opponent unconscious. It’s obvious who the winner is. But according to the rules, the winner must be declared by the judge. And how does the judge declare the winner? He raises the arm of the winner.
>
> By Father God raising Jesus from the dead, he is declaring Jesus the victor over death, hell and the grave!

## What the Resurrection Accomplished

By raising Jesus from the dead, Father God proved:

* **That Jesus is God.** Jesus said he was God and linked his divinity and deity to the fact that God would raise him from the dead.

  Application: the resurrection assures us that our faith should be in Jesus alone. There are no other gods before Jesus!

* **That Jesus was a worthy sacrifice.** By raising Jesus from the dead, Father God declared that he accepted Jesus’ death on the cross as atonement for our sins.

  Application: the resurrection of Jesus, not our own efforts, accomplished full payment for our sins, and guarantees that God has forgiven all our sins—even secret sins—past, present and future.

* **That Jesus is the seed of Abraham who blesses us with righteousness.** By raising Jesus from the dead, Father God confirmed that Jesus is the promised Seed, or Messiah, and through Jesus the believer is made righteous.

  Application: We are 100% righteous before God and the promises of God belong to me because of Jesus’ finished work. Healing, restoration, deliverance, prosperity, peace, joy, wisdom—whatever good thing you need, is only a faith-filled prayer away.

* **That Jesus has gone to prepare a place for us.** By raising Jesus from the dead, Father God declared Jesus’ promise to be true:

John 14:2-3 King James Version \(KJV\)

> 2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
>
> 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

* That Jesus is coming again! By raising Jesus from the dead, God declared

  Jesus will come again to rule and to reign.

### Application:

> **1 Corinthians 15:58 English Standard Version \(ESV\)**
>
> 58 Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.

## Conclusion

Easter is a celebration of what God did for us. I don’t care what you call this day, it is what we are celebrating on this day that is important. We are celebrating that Jesus died for us, and that God raised Jesus from the dead for us. Every aspect of the God’s plan of redemption was for us and we worship him and thank him for that.

_In the name of God, Amen_
