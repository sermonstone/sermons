# The Meaning of the Resurrection

## Introduction

The resurrection of Jesus was a consistent theme in the preaching ministry of
the Apostles. Acts 2, Peterabout the resurrection.

>   22 “Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to
>   you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him
>   in your midst, as you yourselves know— 23 this Jesus, delivered up according
>   to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by
>   the hands of lawless men. 24 God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death,
>   because it was not possible for him to be held by it. 25 For David says
>   concerning him,  
>   “‘I saw the Lord always before me,  
>   for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;  
>   26 therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;  
>   my flesh also will dwell in hope.  
>   27 For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,  
>   or let your Holy One see corruption.  
>   28 You have made known to me the paths of life;  
>   you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’  
>   29 “Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David
>   that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 30
>   Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to
>   him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, 31 he foresaw
>   and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to
>   Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. 32 This Jesus God raised up, and of
>   that we all are witnesses. 33 Being therefore exalted at the right hand of
>   God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he
>   has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. 34 For David
>   did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,  
>   “‘The Lord said to my Lord,  
>   “Sit at my right hand,  
>   35 until I make your enemies your footstool.”’  
>   36 Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made
>   him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”

Acts 10

>   (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+10%3A34-43&version=ESV)

>   34 So Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I understand that God shows no
>   partiality, 35 but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is
>   right is acceptable to him. 36 As for the word that he sent to Israel,
>   preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), 37
>   you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from
>   Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: 38 how God anointed Jesus of
>   Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and
>   healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. 39 And we
>   are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in
>   Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, 40 but God raised
>   him on the third day and made him to appear, 41 not to all the people but to
>   us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after
>   he rose from the dead. 42 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to
>   testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and
>   the dead. 43 To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes
>   in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”

In Acts 13, Luke records a sermon that Paul preached in a synagogue in Antioch.

>   36 For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation,
>   fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption, 37 but he whom
>   God raised up did not see corruption. 38 Let it be known to you therefore,
>   brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, 39
>   and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you
>   could not be freed by the law of Moses.

Paul witnessed to the resurrection

>   [Acts 17:22-32 English Standard Version
>   (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17%3A22-32&version=ESV)

>   22 So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: “Men of Athens, I
>   perceive that in every way you are very religious. 23 For as I passed along
>   and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this
>   inscription: ‘To the unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown,
>   this I proclaim to you. 24 The God who made the world and everything in it,
>   being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, 25 nor
>   is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself
>   gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. 26 And he made from one
>   man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having
>   determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, 27
>   that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find
>   him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, 28 for  
>   “‘In him we live and move and have our being’;  
>   as even some of your own poets have said,  
>   “‘For we are indeed his offspring.’  
>   29 Being then offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like
>   gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.
>   30 The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people
>   everywhere to repent, 31 because he has fixed a day on which he will judge
>   the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he
>   has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”  
>   32 Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But
>   others said, “We will hear you again about this.”

Paul also testified of Christ’s resurrection

>   [Acts 26:19-23 English Standard Version
>   (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+26%3A19-23&version=ESV)

>   19 “Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
>   20 but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout
>   all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent
>   and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance. 21 For
>   this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. 22 To
>   this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here
>   testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and
>   Moses said would come to pass: 23 that the Christ must suffer and that, by
>   being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our
>   people and to the Gentiles.”

## The Biblical Meaning of Resurrection

The word “resurrection” means to be brought back to life. All men have a desire
to live physically and spiritually. This is because God created man to live
forevernot just exist, amoebas and frogs exist, but to have in eternal
fellowship with God. Through sin, death entered the world, and man died
spiritually and physically.

Since the fall of man, people have clung to the hope of a resurrection. Since
God is the giver of life, people understood that God would not only initiate the
resurrection but that the resurrection would involve a judgment over which God,
the just judge, would preside. Therefore, biblically, the concept of
resurrection and judgment go together. Judgment, of course, validation or
approval. When God judges the resurrected, he will express his approval or
disapproval regarding the life they lived and what they believed. We see this
scenario played out in the Gospel of Matthew:

>   [Matthew 25:31-33 New King James Version
>   (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+26%3A19-23&version=ESV)

>   31 “When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with
>   Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. 32 All the nations will be
>   gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a
>   shepherd divides his sheep from the goats. 33 And He will set the sheep on
>   His right hand, but the goats on the left.

### Resurrection as Validation

The Apostles Peter and Paul uniquely applied the to God raising Jesus from the
dead. By raising Jesus and exalting him to sit at his right hand, God validated
everything about truth claims.

## The Meaning to the Church

If you read the passages in their full context on your own time, you will see
that the resurrection of Jesus has important faith implications for the
believer. By God is validating the following :

### That the Bible is the Word of God and Truth

-   The Apostles emphasize that God raised Jesus to the Scriptures. By raising
    Jesus therefore, God is validating that the Scriptures are true. If the Old
    Testament books are riddled with human error, inconsistences, pagan myths
    and fairy tales, they are not . The resurrection means that God the Father
    confirms the Bible as truth.

-   

-   The . Jesus selected Apostles and entrusted them to proclaim and publish his
    message which they did in their letters. Specifically, the Apostle Paul’s
    ministry was validated by the other witnesses to Christ’s resurrection. So,
    the New Testament letters have the same weight and authority the Old
    Testament because in raising Jesus, God was validating the ministry that
    Jesus gave the Apostles.

### That Jesus is God

-   The phrase “Jesus is Lord” means that Jesus is God, and the truth of Jesus
    being God is validated by the resurrection. As Peter said, this Jesus whom
    you crucified God has made both Lord and Christ

-   There are different implications here, but the obvious one is the
    confirmation of one God in three . God raised Jesus from the dead bodily, e
    Spirit of the Son with the dead body that Mary’s womb produced. Jesus
    ascended bodily, which means the Godhead is now what it wasn’t beforeit
    consists of a man, Jesus of Nazareth who is inseparable from God the Son.

-   God the Father exist in a human body, God the Son forever exists as God and
    full man. This is a great wonder, but it expresses God’s incomparable love
    and commitment to man!

### That Jesus is the Chosen One

-   The terms Messiah, Christ, and Chosen One are biblical titles for Jesus (the
    , Chosen One is found in Isaiah 42). Each title carries the meaning of Jesus
    being specially selected by God to accomplish a purpose. However,the words
    Messiah and Christ are so laden with religious that the immediate definition
    is lost on American ears. The “Chosen One” is less religious and perhaps
    better captures Jesus’s purpose. Because Jesus is the Chosen One, it is only
    through Jesus that man may be saved

-   God has settled the common argument that atheists often use to trouble
    Christians. Perhaps you have heard these arguments, such as: Who are you to
    say that Jesus is the only way to heaven?How can you know that other
    religions aren’t true? e know this because God raised Jesus from the dead.
    By doing so, God confirmed that Jesus was the Messiah, the Anointed One, the
    Chosen One, and there is no other name given under heaven by which men may
    be saved.

### That in Jesus Our Sins are Forgiven

-   Under the Law, God did not forgive some sins

-   However, the blood of Jesus is so powerful, and God’s mercy extended to us
    is so great that even unforgivable sins are forgiven in Christ. This truth
    is eternally validated in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.

### 

### That Jesus is the Final Judge

-   God has appointed Jesus to be the final judge for everything and everyone.
    although our sins forgiven, we will account to Jesus for the life we have
    lived during this time on earth.

-   The resurrection of Jesus assures us that all men will indeed be resurrected
    and judged.

-   That means we should be eager to stop sinning and abusing God’s grace and
    get busy for Jesus! Remember: deliverance can take time. If we sincerely
    want to be free from sin but with lust, addictions, fear, etc. God will help
    us. Don’t discouraged; sometimes putting off the old man takes time. I am
    talking about those believers who sin and that God doesn’t care. They are
    deceived.

-   Jesus being the judge means that we can be assured that Jesus will judge
    believers and non-believers alike fairly, justly and with compassion. Again,
    should not let unbelievers confuse us about what will happen to those who
    never heard about Jesus and such arguments. Jesus will judge justly.

*In the name of God, Amen*
